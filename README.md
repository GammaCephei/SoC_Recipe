# Fetch

## Objectives:

- Make a recipe fetcher app utilising API and async/await
- 

## Design:

- Initially logic created - fetching and displaying the recipes
- Styling - mobile first web development - starting with a narrow viewport (tested using chrome device simulator)
-   I implemented one event listener for the whole list, rather than one 
  per element as I didn't want potentially hundreds of them.
